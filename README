## Overview
This project is a simple clicker game, using the Yu-Gi-Oh Monster Kuriboh.
Players earn Kuribohs by clicking on the big center kuriboh, can unlock
upgrades to help Kuriboh production with Pot of Greed, Sinister Serpent, and
Sangan, along with levels/cosmetic upgrades in the many different kuribohs


## Compiling and Using
To compile, execute the following command in the main project directory:
$ javac KuribohClicker.java

Run the compiled class with the command:
$ java KuribohClicker


## Discussion
The first problem I ran into was using bufferedimages but I've clearly improved
since Traffic Animation because it wasn't too hard. I had some issues making the 
timers works becuase I didn't know if you could have multiple timers, or how they
should work together, and how to balance the Kuriboh Economy. I had to teach myself
Grid Bag but that wasn't hard, just long. I started with making the Kuriboh Clicker 
in the central panel work, then made the score update, and continued through all functionality
then once that was completed I started adding the animation and levels of each different
cosemetic Kuribohs. The Errors I got were mostly just me incorrectly adding Mouse Listeners
and Mouse Adapters or Images breaking because I gave them the wrong file name to work with,
but both of these were easy to fix with documentation and just putting in the correct file name.
If I could add more to this, I would add the 3 upgrades I started adding then didn't have the time
or motivation to add, and would make this game more scaleable as I started doing then also gave
up on.
